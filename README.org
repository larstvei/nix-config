* nix-config for macOS

  This repo contains a declarative specification of the setup of my mac, using
  [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]], with [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]] and [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Nix Flakes]]. The initial setup is mimicked after
  [[https://github.com/shaunsingh/nix-darwin-dotfiles][shaunsingh's setup]]. [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] is installed for its cask support (i.e. for mac
  apps lacking a Nix derivation).

  Note that I am a complete novice in Nix, so this is not a reliable source for
  nix-stuffs (copy at your own risk).

* Steps to install

  1. [[https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-macos][Install Nix for macOS]]
     #+begin_src sh
     sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
     #+end_src
  2. [[https://brew.sh/][Install Homebrew]]
     #+begin_src sh
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     #+end_src
  3. Clone this repo (assuming there is no =~/.config= on the system already)
     #+begin_src sh
     git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/larstvei/dotfiles.git ~/.config
     #+end_src
     Note that the =--recurse-submodules= pulls down my [[https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs/][Emacs configuration]],
     which is not necessary for the setup to work.
  4. Build the setup from =flake.nix=
     #+begin_src sh
     cd ~/.config/
     nix build .#darwinConfigurations.larstvei-macbookpro.system --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes
     ./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#larstvei-macbookpro
     #+end_src

* Maintaining

  After making changes, I run the following command (from the =~/.config=
  directory):

  #+begin_src sh
  darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#larstvei-macbookpro
  #+end_src
